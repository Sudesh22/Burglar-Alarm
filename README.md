# Burglar-Alarm
Built using Arduino at its heart and keeping thieves in mind, this device can help keep theives at bay. It consists of 2 IR LEDs(Tx and Rx), Arduino Nano and a Potentiometer

## Working Principle
The project works by constantly checking for a continuous output from the IR Tx LED. Whenever there is a disruption in the patgh between the (Tx anbd Rx) LEDS, the resostance of the Rx IR LED changes which can be read by Analog Pin A0 and can thus trigger the alarm i.e can flash the LED and buzzer connected to Pin
